### YOUR CODE HERE: write at least three functions which solve
### specific tasks by transforming the input x and returning the
### result. Name them according to the task ID as in the three
### examples below. Delete the three examples. The tasks you choose
### must be in the data/training directory, not data/evaluation.

    Description:
        The expected input for this task is a grid with squares of different color.There is an inner and outer square
        (one inside the other) and the orign is the same for both.
        The transformation removes the empty cells and keeps only the part of the grid that contains the squares. 
        Once the grid is "trimmed" the color of the squares is switched.
